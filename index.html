    <h2>
        
        <p class="bg-body-dark text-bg-dark p-4">Nuwara Eliya is Sri Lanka’s highest town and a favourite hill station during British colonial times.
            The town is still touted as ‘Little England’, an illusion maintained by the presence of the Nuwara Eliya
            Golf Club,
            a racecourse, the Victoria Park and excellent trout fishing in nearby lakes and rivers. The temperature can
            drop close
            to freezing at night, and log fires are a common feature of the many Tudor-style houses. Adding to the
            atmosphere is the
            spectacle of its townsfolk wrapped in winter jackets and woolly hats, carting incredible bundles of turnips,
            leeks, marrows
            and cabbages to the markets.
            Due to the high altitude, Nuwara Eliya has a much cooler climate than the lowlands of Sri Lanka, with a mean
            annual temperature
            of 16 °C. But the temperature changes, and sometimes it can be as low as 3°C. It is pretty cold at night in
            the winter, and
            there can even be frost. Although it rapidly warms up as the tropical sun climbs higher during the day.

The Kashmir flycatcher is another attractive bird species in the park.
               Galway's Land Bird Sanctuary, close to Lake Gregory, is an area of montane forest a few kilometers east of the town. Covering an area of 0.6 km2 it is home to many bird and mammal species endemic to Sri Lanka, including wild boar and barking deer.</p>
